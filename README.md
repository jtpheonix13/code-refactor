# Challenge-1-Code-Refactor

## Description

Site Url https://jtpheonix13.github.io/code-refactor/

The goal of this challenge was to refactor the code for the website without changing the function of the page.

### Changes-Made

1. I changed the div tags to more semantic elements such as header, main, nav, aside, and footer.
2. Added alt tags to the images for accessibility.
3. Rearranged the code to flow more inline with the way the site works.
4. Consolidated the main and aside classes as well as the style elements within the stylesheet to remove redundant code.

### Lessons-Learned

I learned that there are multiple ways to solve individual problems and that its easy to end up with redundant and hard to follow code.
